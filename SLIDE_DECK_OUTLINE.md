## Slide 2: The Problem

**Visual:** Icons showing barriers + population statistics

### Content:
```
🚧 India's Digital Divide: Beyond Farmers

📊 The Reality:
• 300M+ functionally illiterate Indians
• 695M+ with limited digital literacy
• Literacy = barrier to digital services

💔 Who's Left Behind?
🌾 146M Farmers
👴 104M Elderly Citizens  
♿ 27M Disabled Persons
🏠 50M Domestic Workers
�️ 139M Daily Wage Workers
🛒 10M Street Vendors
🧕 80M Women in Conservative Families
� 139M Migrant Workers

🚫 Common Barriers:
• Cannot read/type
• English-only apps
• Complex interfaces
• No voice support
• Digital literacy assumed
```

**Key Stat Box:**
"Only 8% of these 695M+ citizens can access digital services"

**Speaker Notes:**
"We often talk about India's digital revolution, but we miss a critical truth: 695 million Indians are excluded from it - not because they don't have phones, but because they cannot read or type. This isn't just about farmers. It's elderly grandmothers checking pensions, disabled citizens seeking independence, domestic workers learning their rights, and daily wage workers tracking MGNREGA payments. Literacy has become a prerequisite for dignity and opportunity - and that's fundamentally wrong."

---

## Slide 3: Impact on All Underserved Populations

**Visual:** Split screen showing different user groups facing challenges

### Content:
```
Real Problems, Real People

🌾 FARMER (146M)
❌ Late pest detection → crop loss
❌ Middlemen exploitation
❌ Unaware of PM-KISAN benefits

👴 ELDERLY (104M)  
❌ Can't check pension online
❌ Miss medicine schedules
❌ Isolated from digital banking

♿ DISABLED (27M)
❌ Screen readers too complex
❌ No Braille (only 1% can read it)
❌ Dependent on others for info

🏠 DOMESTIC WORKER (50M)
❌ Doesn't know minimum wage
❌ Exploited due to ignorance
❌ No access to rights info

�️ DAILY WAGE WORKER (139M)
❌ Can't check MGNREGA payment
❌ Unaware of work injury benefits
❌ No idea about free health schemes

Common Thread: 🚫 LITERACY BARRIER = NO ACCESS
```

**Stat:** "₹3 lakh crore in unclaimed benefits due to lack of awareness"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let me show you what this looks like in real life. A farmer loses his crop because he couldn't read pest control advice online. An elderly woman walks 5 km to check her pension because she can't use the app. A disabled person depends on others for every piece of information, losing independence and dignity. A domestic worker is paid ₹3,000 when minimum wage is ₹5,000, simply because she doesn't know her rights. These aren't edge cases - this is daily reality for 695 million Indians."

## Slide 4: The Solution - Vaani

**Visual:** Large app screenshot with key features highlighted

### Content:
```
🎤 VAANI - Eliminating Literacy as a Barrier

✨ Voice-First Design
   No typing, no reading required
   Just speak naturally

🇮🇳 Local Languages
   Hindi, English, Hinglish
   (10+ languages planned)

🌐 Offline-Ready
   Works without internet
   70% features available

👥 Universal Design
   For EVERYONE left behind:
   Farmers | Elderly | Disabled
   Workers | Women | Children

🆓 Free & Accessible
   No subscription, no barriers
   Open source, community-driven

📱 Multi-Platform
   Web | Mobile (future)
   WhatsApp | USSD | Kiosks
```

**Tagline:** "If you can SPEAK, you deserve EQUAL ACCESS"

**Stat:** "695M+ Indians. One voice platform."

**Speaker Notes:**
"Vaani's core insight is simple but profound: literacy should never determine access to information, rights, or opportunities. We started with farmers, but quickly realized the solution is universal. Whether you're a 70-year-old checking your pension, a disabled person seeking independence, or a domestic worker learning your rights - Vaani works the same way: speak your question, get your answer. No apps to learn. No text to read. No barrier between you and the information you need."

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let me show you how Vaani serves different users. [Run 2-3 quick queries showing different user types]. Notice: same simple interface, same voice interaction, but completely different needs being met. A pension query for an elderly user. Crop advice for a farmer. Workers' rights information. Emergency numbers. This is universal design in action - one platform, infinite use cases, 695 million lives."
