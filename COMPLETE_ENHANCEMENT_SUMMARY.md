```powershell
choco install ffmpeg -y
```

**Option B: Download Manually**
1. Download from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
2. Extract to `C:\ffmpeg`
3. Add `C:\ffmpeg\bin` to PATH

### Step 3: Verify Everything Works

python test_voice.py

# Test performance improvements
python verify_improvements.py

# Run Vaani
python main.py
```

---

## üé§ How to Use the New Voice

### Default (News Anchor Voice - Enabled)

The professional news anchor voice is **enabled by default**:

```python
from Voice_tool import bolo_stream

# Automatically uses news anchor voice
bolo_stream("‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á, ‡§Æ‡•à‡§Ç ‡§µ‡§æ‡§£‡•Ä ‡§π‡•Ç‡§Å")
```

### Switch to Original Voice (If Needed)

```python
# Use original gTTS voice
bolo_stream("Hello", voice_style='default')
```

### In Main Application

The voice is already integrated - just run:
```powershell
python main.py
```

All audio output will use the professional news anchor voice! üéâ

## üéõÔ∏è Customization Options

### Adjust Voice Pitch

Edit `Voice_tool.py`, line ~35:
```python
# Higher pitch (more feminine)
octaves = 0.4  # Default is 0.3

# Lower pitch (deeper)
octaves = 0.2
```

### Adjust Speaking Speed

Edit `Voice_tool.py`, line ~40:
```python
# Faster (energetic)
speed_audio = pitched_audio.speedup(playback_speed=1.10)

# Slower (calmer)
speed_audio = pitched_audio.speedup(playback_speed=1.02)
```

### Adjust Volume

Edit `Voice_tool.py`, line ~43:
```python
# Louder (more authoritative)
emphasized_audio = speed_audio + 4

# Softer (gentle)
emphasized_audio = speed_audio + 1
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Voice sounds robotic
**Solution**: 
```python
# In Voice_tool.py, reduce pitch shift
octaves = 0.2  # Instead of 0.3
```

### Issue: Voice is too fast
**Solution**:
```python
# In Voice_tool.py, reduce speed
speed_audio = pitched_audio.speedup(playback_speed=1.02)
```

### Issue: "ffmpeg not found"
**Solution**:
```powershell
choco install ffmpeg -y
# Or download from ffmpeg.org
```

### Issue: Voice quality is poor
**Solution**: The base voice is from gTTS. For even better quality, consider:
- Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API
- Amazon Polly
- Azure Speech Services
